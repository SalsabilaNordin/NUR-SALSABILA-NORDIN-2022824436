  <h3>Wedding Ceremony</h3>
  <p>This was during Salsabila's mid-semester break. She went to her Mimi's friend's daughter wedding and ate a lot of good food. 
Her sister took this picture of her and her Mimi. Just a little bit of TMI here, Salsabila is scared of her 
Mimi more than anything else. Though, the 48 year old woman is the one that she always relies on, and the one that 
she will always look back to when she is sad. It is the same for Mimi, actually. She is a very overprotective mother towards
Salsabila. But that is understandable cause Salsabila is a daughter. What kind of mother would not be worried over a daughter, right?
Every mother wants the best for their children.</p>
