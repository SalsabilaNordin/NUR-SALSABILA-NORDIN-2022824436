Just a light filming, or should we call it as recording? <br>
<br>
She just loves recording things to keep them all as memories. <br>
She tends to remember things easily, but she also forget things faster. <br>
That is one of the reason why she always record herself, and all the people around her! <p>&#9829; <br>
